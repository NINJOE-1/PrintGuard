___
1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)**
- (7 to 8 hours)
  
2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:***

i. Top item: met with the team to finalize the project proposal template breaking down the tasks between the group and deciding on what to work on for the project like dividing the componemts and distributing roles and tasks. (1.5 hours)

ii. 2nd item: researched about my component which is temperature and humidity control, researched a specific sensor DHT22 which monitors temperature because we will be using that specific sesnor. (2 hours)

iii. 3rd item: wrote component details temperature control in the project proposal and  researched about the use case and the UML sequence diagram that should be in the proposal draft 1. Completed all the work required for my part and additionally did the Table Of Contents. (4 hours)
  
3. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** 
- I dedicated time to researching my component, focusing on temperature and humidity control. Specifically, I delved into the functionality and specifications of the DHT22 sensor, crucial for monitoring temperature within our project scope ensuring a thorough understanding of the sensor's capabilities.
- I documented the details of temperature control within the project proposal, integrating my research findings into the narrative. Additionally, I undertook the task of crafting a comprehensive Table of Contents, facilitating easier navigation within the document.
- I also researched and wrote a use case regarding my component and designed a UML sequence diagram.
  
4. ***How do you feel about your progress?***
- I feel positive and satisfied with the progress made this week. Our collaborative effort to finalize the project proposal template was productive. I'm motivated and confident in our progress.
5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_
  - learn how to connect the Arduino to the raspberry pi 
  - research about Arduinos with raspberry pi
  - research about notifications and warnings from sms for the 3D printer
  - finish final draft of proposal
6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?***
  - No nothing for now
